Contributing
============

Community contributions are most welcome. Here are a couple of guidelines for
contributions.

* Install the dev. environment with `npm install`.
* Use GitHub pull requests.
* Reference existing open GitHub issues in commits where relevant.
* Styles, Tests: Always run `npm run check` to run all style and test checks.
  This is a test library -- it should pass its own tests. ;)
* Generation: Please run `npm run build` to correctly generate all appropriate files
  before finishing up and submitting your pull request.

And, thanks!
